# Alex's Telegram Bot

Pretty useless bot. Only remotely useful feature is the /weather command. I just wanted to see if I could make a C# telegram bot for fun.

## List of Commands: 

/inline   - send inline keyboard


/keyboard - send custom keyboard


/photo    - send a photo


/request  - request location or contact


/weather <zip code> - Returns the weather in the given zipcode. If no zipcode is given, it defaults to 17601.
